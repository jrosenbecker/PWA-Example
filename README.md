# PWA-Example
A small application for use in displaying how a progressive web app and service workers function

[See the hosted example here!](https://rosenbecker-pwa-example.herokuapp.com)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure Node & NPM are installed
3. Run `npm install`
4. Install webpack globally using `npm install webpack -g`

## Running The Application
Webpack is used to build the bundled javascript files that the server actually uses. To run webpack, run `webpack`. If you are actively making changes, you can use `webpack --watch` to have it build changes as you go.

To host the server, use the command `npm start`.
